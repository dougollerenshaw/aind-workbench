METADATA SERVICE MIGRATION - COMPLETE
======================================

Successfully migrated Fiber Schematic Viewer from DocDB to AIND Metadata Service.

WHAT CHANGED:
-------------
1. Replaced aind-data-access-api with aind-metadata-service-client
2. Simplified get_procedures_for_subject() - removed 3-stage fallback, now single metadata service query
3. Removed --db_host and --database command-line arguments (no longer needed)
4. Updated README and documentation

WHY:
----
- Metadata service is authoritative source (pulls from surgical records, LabTracks, etc.)
- DocDB only has data AFTER upload
- Result: More comprehensive data (e.g., subject 775741 now shows 2 fibers instead of 1)

TESTING:
--------
✓ Subject 804434: 2 fibers found (matches DocDB)
✓ Subject 775741: 2 fibers found (DocDB only had 1)
✓ Both subjects work end-to-end in the app
✓ Command-line help updated correctly

PERFORMANCE:
------------
- Query time: ~30-40 seconds per subject (vs ~1-2s for DocDB)
- Trade-off accepted for more comprehensive data

FILES MODIFIED:
---------------
- projects/fiber-schematic-viewer/pyproject.toml (dependencies)
- projects/fiber-schematic-viewer/app.py (simplified query function)
- projects/fiber-schematic-viewer/README.md (documentation)
- projects/tool-launcher/pyproject.toml (added metadata service client)

FILES DELETED:
--------------
- projects/fiber-schematic-viewer/test_metadata_service.py (cleanup)

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:
-----------------------
- get_procedures_for_subject() still accepts db_host parameter (ignored)
- No breaking changes to API
