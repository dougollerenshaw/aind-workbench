Chatting with Saskia about the approach for generating metadata here:
* for metadata, approach each of the 5 categories one at a time
* rig is going to very different, give it a name (e.g. sue_ephys_rig_v1), get as much info as possible. 
* Many mice will have procedures in the NSB data. Use endpoint when possible.
* Rigs here at the institute - we should be able to make a rig.json (and maybe it already esists)
* May need to add a new probe type in data schema models devices.ProbeModel class to represent tetrodes
* don't worry about angles in ephys session. 
* In session, get as much stimulus epoch info as possible from data files. 
* I need to check with David on data organization. Sue currently has a data organization that combines raw and processed data. How do we handle this? This is relevant to old Hopkins data, not data being actively collected.
